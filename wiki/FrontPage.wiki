#summary A wiki for the frontpage (this line will not be visible on the front page)

*DebPPA* (Debian PPA) is the same as the Ubuntu PPA, but for Debian. It's in development with the aim of having the exact same functionality as the Ubuntu PPA.

Please follow the links in my initial [http://groups.google.com/group/debppa-devel/browse_thread/thread/a6c9f955d0d5da25 email] for the motivation and goals of this project.

See the Installation wiki page (on the right panel) for documentation.

I am currently working on:

http://wiki.debian.org/svnbuildstat

and I will merge debppa with svnbuildstat. This will provide the service we need and much more. Please, join us as well.


Please report all bugs (into the [http://code.google.com/p/debppa/issues/list Issues], or to the [http://groups.google.com/group/debppa-devel mailinglist]).
