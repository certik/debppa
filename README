Installation:
-------------

wajig install python-django python-pysqlite2

Usage:
------

./manage.py runserver

and point your browser to the address shown. You can also specify the port
manually:

./manage.py runserver 8080

Database:
---------

The whole database is in the "database" file, no configuration is needed. You
can backup this file and restore it later, it will work (no need to setup
anything). If you delete it, you need to issue:

./manage.py syncdb

This will create a fresh new database file (and asks you to create a super user
account, that is used in the admin interface).
