**DebPPA** (Debian PPA) is the same as the Ubuntu PPA, but for Debian. It's in development with the aim of having the exact same functionality as the Ubuntu PPA.

Please follow the links in my initial [email](http://groups.google.com/group/debppa-devel/browse_thread/thread/a6c9f955d0d5da25) for the motivation and goals of this project.

See the Installation wiki page (on the right panel) for documentation.

I am currently working on:

http://wiki.debian.org/svnbuildstat

and I will merge debppa with svnbuildstat. This will provide the service we need and much more. Please, join us as well.


Please report all bugs (into the [Issues](http://code.google.com/p/debppa/issues/list), or to the [mailinglist](http://groups.google.com/group/debppa-devel)).
